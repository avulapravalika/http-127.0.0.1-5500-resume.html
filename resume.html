        <h1><span>P</span>ROJECTS</h1>
        <h2>1.Automating Customer Sentiment Detection Using Machine Learning</h2>
        <P>This project involves building a web-based sentiment analysis system that
        automatically classifies user opinions or reviews as positive, negative, or neutral.
        Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques and Machine Learning 
        algorithms, the system analyzes customer 
        feedback in real-time.The goal of this project is to help businesses understand
        customer emotions more efficiently, enabling better decision-making. I used tools like Python, scikit-learn, and NLTK, and applied techniques such as text preprocessing, TF-IDF vectorization, 
        and logistic regression/classification models for sentiment prediction.</P>
        <h2>2.Smart Healthcare Diagnosis Using Deep Learning</h2>
        <p>This project focuses on building an intelligent healthcare diagnosis system using Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN). 
        The model analyzes patient data or medical images to detect diseases with improved accuracy and speed.
        It aims to support doctors and healthcare professionals by 
        providing early diagnosis suggestions, reducing manual workload, and enhancing decision-making. This solution is especially helpful in remote areas with limited medical resources.
        The system was developed using Python, Keras/TensorFlow, and real-time datasets for training and testing. It demonstrates the power of deep learning in transforming traditional healthcare 
        into smart, data-driven decision systems.</p>
